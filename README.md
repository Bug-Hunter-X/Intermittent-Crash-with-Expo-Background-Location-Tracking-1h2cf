## Intermittent Crash with Expo Background Location Tracking

This repository demonstrates a bug related to intermittent crashes when using background location tracking with the `expo-location` library. The app appears to function correctly for a period but eventually crashes or stops updating location data without any clear error message. The root cause is likely a combination of improper handling of background location updates and potential race conditions or memory leaks.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code that may lead to these crashes, while `bugSolution.js` provides a revised implementation aimed at resolving this issue by employing better error handling and optimizing background location updates.
