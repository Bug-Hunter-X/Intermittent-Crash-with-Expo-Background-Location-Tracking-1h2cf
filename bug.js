This error occurs when using the `expo-location` library in combination with background location tracking. The app might crash or fail to update the location properly. The problem stems from not properly handling the location updates in the background, which can cause race conditions or memory leaks. It's often masked by seeming to work intermittently, making it challenging to reproduce and debug.
